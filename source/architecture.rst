Architecture
============

There will be obviously a software running on the computer, let's call it the **GatewayManager** from now
and a software running on the gateways, let's call it the **Kernel** from now.

The both will communicate together via some **channels** using a **messaging protocol**.

Channels
--------

For simplicity, only bidirectionnal channels with both ends initiatives will be considered at first glance.

Example of channels to be considered:

* `UART <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter>`_
* `WiFi <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi>`_/`Ethernet <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet>`_/`IP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol>`_:

  * `TCP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol>`_
    (with eventually `SSL/TLS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_)
  * `UDP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol>`_

* `Bluetooth <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth>`_/`BLE <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_Low_Energy>`_/`BLE Mesh <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_mesh_networking>`_
* `USB <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB>`_
* `Zigbee <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee>`_
* `LoRa <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa>`_
* `CAN <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus>`_
* ...

Example of channels not to be considered:

* `SPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface>`_ (master only initiative)
* `IÂ²C <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C>`_ (master only initiative)
* `1-Wire <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire>`_ (master only initiative)
* ...

In the first version of the architecture, we will consider channels as perfect: no data loss and no
data corruption. `ECC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code>`_ and
`acknoledgement <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)>`_
mechanisms might be considered in next versions. Moreover, some channels mentionned above already
implement these mechanisms.

Messaging protocol
------------------

We want something simple to use at code level, efficient and which doesn't imply to introduce a big
complexity in the project structure.

When considering messaging protocol, there is several questions to answer:

1. How do I know the beginning and the end of my message?
2. How do I know which type of message did I receive?
3. How do I parse the message, knowing it's type?
   How much does it cost in term of memory and computation time?
4. What's the information quantity/message size ratio?
