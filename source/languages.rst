Supported Languages
===================

:repository:`Gateways <gateway>`
--------------------------------

On gateway side, things have to be small, efficient and compatible with most of the plateform.
Only pure C match all this requirement, even C++ is not always supported on each plateform.

:repository:`GatewayManager <gateway-manager>`
----------------------------------------------

For simplicity and avoid to much work when a new peripheral will be ported to the project,
core will be coded in C++ and automatic an binder for other languages will be developped for
supported languages. This will ensure coherent API between the different ports of each language.
